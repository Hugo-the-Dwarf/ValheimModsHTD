Adds 9 new Two Handed Weapons to Valheim. Customized to feel like they are practical with damage numbers to match what a two-handed weapon should be.
These Weapons also have their own visual look while on Item Stands.


Installation:
Move the "ValheimMoreTwoHanders.dll" into your Plugins folder.


Config:
A config file is generated that will allow you to enable/disable the recipes for each one, tweak their damage stats, the Name, and Description (temporary means of localization), and where it is crafted, the min level of the station, and the max level the weapon can be upgraded to.
Can also set a Hotkey to use the weapon's 3rd attack, default is "mouse 3" which would be the 4th button on your mouse if it has such.


ChangeLog:
V 3.0.1 => V 3.0.2:
-Fixed issue of the weapons being indestructible. They will function like all weapons do now, using durability.
V 3.0 => V 3.0.1:
-Possibly Fixed Visual errors with Vulkan Mode, Those that like or have to run with Vulkan rejoice(maybe)
-Fixed Critcal Issue with Great Maces, Secondary and Third Attacks were missing the setting to hit more than one enemy. Which resulted in either hitting the ground and doing nothing, or just one target (which makes no sense for AoE like attacks)
V 2.0 => V 3.0:
-Added Silver Battleaxe
-Added Black Metal Battleaxe
-Updated All weapon textures
-Parry Multipiers on Two Handers are now 3.5 from 4
-Validated that Silver and Black Metal Sword is -10% mov speed, axes are -15%, and heavier ones are -20%
-Adjusted Damage numbers with some more math
-Implemented Hotkey, and Function for doing a 3rd attack for all 9 weapons.
