Adds 13 new Two Handed Weapons to Valheim. Customized to feel like they are practical with damage numbers to match what a two-handed weapon should be.
These Weapons also have their own visual look while on Item Stands.


Installation:
Move the "ValheimMoreTwoHanders.dll" into your Plugins folder.


Config:
A config file is generated that will allow you to enable/disable the recipes for each one, tweak their damage stats, the Name, and Description (temporary means of localization), and where it is crafted, the min level of the station, and the max level the weapon can be upgraded to.
Can also set a Hotkey to use the weapon's 3rd attack, default is "mouse 3" which would be the 4th button on your mouse if it has such.
