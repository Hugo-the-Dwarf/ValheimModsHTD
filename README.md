# ValheimMoreTwoHanders
Adds 7 new Two Handed Weapons to Valheim. Customized to feel like they are practical with damage numbers to match what a two-handed weapon should be.
These Weapons also have their own visual look while on Item Stands.

Installation:
The Assetbundle is not embedded in the .dll file now. So you can remove the bundle file "twohandedweapons" and just have the .dll "ValheimMoreTwoHanders" in your Plugins folder.


Config:
A config file is generated that will allow you to enable/disable the recipes for each one, tweak their damage stats, the Name, and Description (temporary means of localization), and where it is crafted, the min level of the station, and the max level the weapon can be upgraded to.


ChangeLog:
V 1.0 => V 2.0:
Added Config
Added Blue version of the Great Mace, that does Frost damage
Added Flametal Great Sword strong as Moder's Sorrow
Changed Green Core Mace to Great Toxic Mace (Poison Damage)
All Great Maces require Iron and no Flametal but still need Surtling Cores, Guck, and Crystals for the elements.
All Two Handed Swords now do a Over-Head Slash instead of a stab (like Moder's Sorrow)
All Two Handed Weapons now have a Parry Mult of 4 instead of 7 (Block skill was increasing the block value way too much, making a decent block skill let you parry anything)
